            <p>These are some of my side projects where I take design licences and experiment with both front and back
                end code.</p>
            <p>I get inspired by printed press, architecture, music, fashion, art and the web of course.</p>
            <p>I like to challenge myself to turn rough ideas and graphic design into responsive web pages with a
                meaning.</p>

                <p>As soon as I saw the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cinzel" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Cinzel font</a> I thought it looked very
                    regal. Since I don't expect any time soon to be crowned king, I settled for the title of duke
                    (self-assigned of course). <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/roseland" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">The Roseland</a> is one of my favourite place ever in Cornwall. I also
                    used a
                    double border and a box shadow. Colour cornsilk, coincidently enough.</p>

                    far from it. I got the idea from the <a

                </a>
                <p>Do you ever feel like you've been over entertained? Social media, bill boards, tv, the internet,
                    music at any venue, radio in the car, etc. Or indeed you over entertain yourself by watching silly
                    YouTube videos? I used css grid to put the iframes in place and had to find videos about 10 seconds
                    long in order not to be too demanding of the data fetch. Enabling autoplay was key to delivering the
                    message.</p>

                <p>Whilst hearing about cyclist events on the news lately, I noticed this traditional colour palette.
                    I've
                    been meaning to make something with it for a while since it reminds me of my childhood for some
                    reasons. I then had to think about something that cycles and if it's true that we pretty much do the
                    same things every day and every other length of time, life is a cycle! It was also convenient to
                    apply a simple rotating animation, mimicking the spinning wheels of a bicycle. The bands of colours
                    live in flexbox rows as I prefer that to design assets. Font <a

                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Baumans</a> was round enough to fit the theme.</p>

                <p>I was intrigued by the way the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic_transcription"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">phonetic transcription</a> of my name looked. I liked
                    how it features two long suprasegmentals (the little triangles) and how the postalveolar resembles a
                    number 3. After I drafted it, I came across a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blueprint</a> and
                    thought the colour palette and thin font weight would go well together. Font <a
